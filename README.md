# An-Al-Enabled-Clinical-Decision-Support-System-for-Automatic-Sereening-of-Diabetic-Retinopathy-
Project Overview:This Project was developed during my internship to automate and streamline the analysis of retinal images for early detection of diabetic retinopathy.
Diabetic retinopathy is an eye condition that can cause vision loss and blindness in people who have diabetes. It affects blood vessels in the retina (the light-sensitive layer of tissue in the back of your eye).
If you have diabetes, it’s important to get a comprehensive dilated eye exam at least once a year. Diabetic retinopathy may not have any symptoms at first — but finding it early can help you take steps to protect your vision. 

Project Domain :Artificial Intelligence 

Tech Stack :Python,TensorFlow/keras,OpenCV,Numpy and Pandas.

Modules:This Project contains two modules:
Module 1: To develop an improved CNN architecture and algorithm for automatic detection and classification of DR.
Module 2: To develop a hybrid deep learning architecture which combines CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) for improving DR detection performance.
